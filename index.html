               <p id="titlefirst"> What I will learn during this course: </p>
               <li><span>1.</span><p> <strong>Git and Github:</strong> <br>
                 GitHub is a code hosting platform for version control and collaboration.
                 It lets you and others work together on projects from anywhere.
                 You'll create your own Hello World repository and
                 learn GitHub's Pull Request workflow,
                 a popular way to create and review code.</p></li>
               <li><span>2.</span><p> <strong> HTML5: </strong>
                 <br>
                 HTML5 is a programming language whose acronym stands for
                 Hyper Text Markup Language.
                 It is a system that allows the modification of the appearance of web pages,
                 as well as making adjustments to their appearance.
                 It also used to structure and present content for the web.
                </p></li>
               <li><span>3.</span><p> <strong> CSS3: </strong> <br>
                 CSS stands for "Cascading Style Sheet."
                 Cascading style sheets are used to format the layout of Web pages.
                 Plus, CSS makes it easy to change styles across several pages at once.
                 For example, a Web developer may want to increase the default text
                 size from 10pt to 12pt for fifty pages of a Web site.
               </p></li>
               <li><span>4.</span><p> <strong>Javascript: </strong> <br>
                 JavaScript is a client scripting language which is used for creating web pages.
                 It is a standalone language developed in Netscape.
                 It is used when a webpage is to be made dynamic and add
                 special effects on pages like rollover, roll out and many types of graphics.
               </p></li>
               <li><span>5.</span><p> <strong>Node.JS:</strong> <br>
                 Node.js is a platform built on Chrome's JavaScript
                 runtime for easily building fast and scalable
                 network applications. Node.js uses an event-driven,
                 non-blocking I/O model that makes it lightweight and efficient,
                 perfect for data-intensive real-time applications that run
                 across distributed devices.
               </p></li>
               <li><span>6.</span><p> <strong>PHP:</strong> <br>
                 PHP is a server side scripting language that is used to develop
                 Static websites or Dynamic websites or Web applications.
                 PHP stands for Hypertext Pre-processor, that earlier stood for
                 Personal Home Pages. PHP scripts can only be interpreted on a
                 server that has PHP installed.
               </p></li>
               <li><span>7.</span><p> <strong>ReactJS:</strong> <br>
                 ReactJS basically is an open-source JavaScript library
                 which is used for building user interfaces specifically for
                 single page applications. It's used for handling view layer
                 for web and mobile apps. React also allows us to create
                 reusable UI components.
