Hi There!
Welcome to my first project. It's the first website that I made, so please be gentle.

WHO AM I?
My name is Lisa Cantaert (hence the "cant" in my name). I'm a junior web developer student learning new skills everyday.

HUH? WHY THIS WEBSITE?
This is my first project, so why not make a website to introduce myself? Since this is my first project, it's still pretty basic. I'll
pdate this website during my process!

What you can find on this page:
  - Intro/What I will learn during the course
  - Some more information about myself
  - How to contact me
